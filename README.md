Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address? Artemis financial is a coompany that develops plans for savings,retirement,investments, andinsurance for thier customers. Artemis were seeking to add a file to verify their web application to ensure secure connections. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I think that I did well identifying false positiveres when it came to checking for vulnerbilities in the project. I think its important to code securely so that we can reduce the chance of exposting vulnerabilites within the code. Adding security adds safety and procection to Artemis wellbeing and protection.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
I think this whole class was pretty challenging, with lack of directions and lack of help. I feel like I wasn't fully grasping the consepts. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I add what the project needed for security, I think it added some layers of security. Updating the checks and databases in the the future would be needed for the project.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
The code and application were both functional and secure by preforming static testing. Updating the code I ran the same test cases in order to make sure the the project was safe and operational.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Youtube mostly help understating how ther maven dependency checker tool worked.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Nothing, I feel like I still need more learning in this secure coding.
